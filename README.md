The dataset contains a sample 10000 images mined from Instagram
and clustered based on the hairstyle they showcase.

The variable `cluster`  represents the hairstyle cluster that the image has been assigned to by 
the visual recognition algorithm...

Each row contains the variable `url` which is the link to the image and  the number of likes
together with the `comments` per image . The `user_id`  is the unique id of the Instagram account
from which the post comes and the variable  `id`  is the unique identifier associated with the post
itself..
